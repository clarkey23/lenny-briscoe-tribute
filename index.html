    <p>The man was not perfect. The small insights we were provided about his personal life revealed many problems. Broken home. Poor relationships with childen. However, we meet a man who had come to terms with all of his earlier miscomings and found purpose as a detective. </p>
    <p>We meet a smart, witty man who has built rapport with many characters throughout NY and was great at his job. He cut through the BS and was a pleasure to watch on TV.</p>
    <p>Someone should create a YT compiliation of all of his initial crime scene one-liners. It will not be me.</p>
